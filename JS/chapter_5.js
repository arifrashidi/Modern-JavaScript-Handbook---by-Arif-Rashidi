// 🧡 An High-Level Overview of JavaScrip

// -----------------
// ❕ Monster definition of JavaScript

// JAVASCRIPT IS A HIGH-LEVEL, PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED, MULTI-PARADIGM, INTERPRETED OR JUST-IN-TIME COMPILED,
// DYNAMIC, SINGLE-THREADED, GARBAGE-COLLECTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WITH FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS AND A NON-BLOCKING
// EVENT LOOP CONCURRENCY MODEL

// -----------------
// ❕ Deconstructing the monster definition of JavaScript

// 🔗 1. High level
// 📝 These language have so-called abstractions that will manage our resources automatically.
// 📝This makes the language easier to learn and to use, but the downside is that programs will never be as fast...
// or as optimized as for example, C programs.


// 🔗 2. Garbage-collected
// 📝 Garbage-collection is a powerful tool inside the JavaScript engine, which automatically removes...
// old & unused objects from the computer memory from time to time.
// 📝 So that we don't have to manage our memory manually.
